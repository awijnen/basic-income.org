Side project to raise awareness and gauge interest for the concept of universal basic income. If you want more information I suggest you checkout this video:
http://evonomics.com/how-universal-basic-income-solves/

Features:
- simple voting mechanism (yes/no)
- votes saved to MongoDB database
- after voting users are asked to register with Facebook to authenticate
	* Facebook ID used to count unique voters
	* Authentication after voting action, to make treshold for CTA as low possible
- anayltics package (okgrow:analytics) used to send events to mixpanel for analysis
- The data in mixpanel shows that people are quick to vote (70% of visitors vote), but they're reluctant to authenticate (only 7% of voters authenticate with facebook account)

Still have the original url (www.basic-income.org). If anyone wants to put it back online and do something with it, let me know.
